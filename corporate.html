      <h4 class="mt-4 big_headers">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p class="body_crp">Our Social Media campaign aimed to introduce users to our brand, inform them about our products and create a connection between them and Plot. The message of our campaign is revealed in our very first Instagram post: “Live life with a twist”. The campaign aims to encourage people to live their life to the fullest, by breaking routines and standards and taking any chance that comes their way.</p>
      <p class="body_crp">Our campaign was spread among 2 platforms, Instagram and TikTok. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="body_crp">Instagram served an informative role, being the main channel where we communicated details about our 4 beers and their corresponding personalities. On Instagram, we structured our posts in triads (see pictures at the bottom of the page) in order to bring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing look and feel of our page. With highly-visual, colourful posts, we presented users our 4 beers: the Green, Yellow, Blue and Red beer. We explained how each one of these beers is linked to a personality that people can identify themselves with. Nonetheless, as our brand aims to encourage people to embrace spontaneity in their lives, we provided users with suggestions of leisure activities, perfectly tailored to the 4 colour-personalities.Furthermore, we covered a number of key trends in order to potentially reach and engage a larger audience. Consider the following example:</p>
		
		<ul class="body_crp">
<li>All of our images and videos, including our name (logo), follow a consistent theme. As previously stated, the content is highly-visual, 'groovy,' and colorful. Consistency, we believe, helps to build and improve a brand culture while maintaining a professional and recognizable appearance. ;</li>
<li>To broaden our reach, we are using Hashtags. Hashtags are words or phrases that are used to identify specific messages or topics in our content. Since Instagram feeds change frequently, hashtags are the only identifiers that enable posts to be found endlessly.
 </li>
<li>Sharing our followers’ tagged photos on our story. Reposting other people's stories or photos that are related to 'Plot' is a great way to engage with our own followers. </li>
</ul>
		<p class="body_crp"><strong>Profile Grid</strong></p>
<ul class="body_crp">
  <li>The first triad introduced our brand to users, with the use of a product mock-up, the brand’s logo and slogan. We believe this was a strong start of our campaign, as now users acknowledged the key pillars of our brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Then, we posted 4 triads, each dedicated to one of our beers: the Green, Blue, Red and Yellow beers. On the right post of each triad, we described the personality that the beer represents. In the middle post, we presented the beer itself, revealing the new creative labels. Lastly, the left post featured a slogan (“Live life green/blue/red/yellow), and some suggestions of activities that are perfectly tailored for those who identify with the respective beer and personality. </li>
  <li>Our last triad was dedicated to the brand’s activities, a game and a quiz, launching as well our recyclable 6-pack. </li>
	<li>Each of the 18 posts includes not only visual content, but also a caption that explains the message. </li>
</ul>
		
		
		<p class="body_crp"><strong>Instagram Stories</strong></p>
<ul class="body_crp">
  <li>The goal of the first story was to subtly introduce our brand, encouraging people to learn more about our vision and mission. 
</li>
  <li>Our content designer also created a post for 'The International Day of Happiness.' This is a fantastic opportunity to show our spirit ('Live Life with a Twist') to the target audience since the topic is strongly related to our vision. 
 </li>
  <li>	Our Instagram page reached 50 (and more) followers on March 20th. As a result, we posted an appreciation post to thank everyone for their interest and support. 
</li>
	<li>Our followers"mentions' were reposted, as well as new content about the plot brand.  </li>
	<li>To keep our followers intrigued, our content creator created interactive posts that had them guessing flavors, colors, and other things.
  </li>
</ul>
		
		
		
	<p class="body_crp"><strong>Instagram Reels</strong></p>
<ul class="body_crp">
  <li>In terms of reels on Instagram, we considered following what is trendy. In this case, a 'round trip recap' where you shoot 'aesthetically' pleasing locations, but this time with our brand included. The user will not only enjoy the content, but also engage with our brand. Rather than uploading static posts, we must create unique lifestyle content to depict Plot and add scenarios to our product. We believe that using real-life backgrounds, scenes, and models will give our beer a more authentic and inspiring appearance to customers.
 
</li>
  <li>In order to maintain consistency, our team added two tiktok posts to our Instagram account, to ensure that both accounts are on the same page in terms of content.

 </li>
  
		
		<br>
	
	<p class="body_crp"> On TikTok, we raised awareness around our brand in a playful manner. Our strategy was to identify trends and “jump on them”, all while presenting either our products or the value propositions of our brand. We created TikTok videos to illustrate the creative process behind Plot beers (Video 1), and we used this platform to announce the release of new versions of our products (Video 3). With our second video, we introduced viewers to our unique value propositions, communicating that Plot is the perfect source of “free-time activities tailored to your personality”.  </p>
		
	  <h4 class="mt-4 medium_headers">Reach objectives</h4>
		
		<ul class="body_crp">
			 <h4 class="mt-4">Instagram reach of 5.000</h4>
<li> Our Instagram reach was of 5.794 as of the 13th of April 2022. We successfully reached our goal and exceeded it, proving that our Instagram campaign was effective in creating awareness around our brand.
</li>
</ul>
		<ul class="body_crp">
			 <h4 class="mt-4">TikTok reach of 5.000</h4>
<li> Our TikTok reach was of 1.935 as of the 13th of April 2022. However, at the beginning of our campaign we posted 3 videos while we had not yet turned on the Analytics function, leaving us able to see only the number of views and shares. For the other videos, we noticed that our reach was approximately equal to the number of views. We, therefore, approximate that we would have an added reach of 1980 for the first 3 videos, adding up to a total reach of approximately 3915. In conclusion, we did not reach our TikTok goal.
</li>
</ul>
	  <h4 class="mt-4 medium_headers">Explanation of chosen channels/platforms</h4>
		
		
		<ul class="body_crp"> 
		<li> As previously mentioned in the “Media Tactics” section of the Justification Document, we chose to conduct our marketing campaign on Instagram and TikTok. This choice was supported by the results of our campaign, as the reached audience fits the objectives that we set. As seen in the picture below, our Instagram followers were mainly in the 18-24 years old age group, and 75.9% of this audience is located in The Netherlands. Our target group consists of people aged between 18 and 25 which live in The Netherlands, therefore Instagram proved to be an effective platform for our brand. </li>
			<li> Our reached audience on TikTok was mostly from The Netherlands, again aligning with the target group we chose before the start of our campaign.</li>

  </ul>

      <h4 class="mt-4 big_headers">Learning Points</h4>
      <h4 class="mt-4 medium_headers">What worked?</h4>
		
		<ul class="body_crp">
<li>During the first week of our campaign, we reached an impressive number of followers, with around 100 users joining our community. As the members of our team heavily promoted Plot on their social media accounts, the majority of this early community consisted of friends and family members. Word also spread among students from our university, which further raised awareness about our brand. Therefore, the “word-of-mouth” marketing worked well at the beginning of our campaign.</li>
			<br>
	<li>Our “Plot in paradise” reel had a high success, with almost 2.000 plays and a reach of 1.702. This reel is a high-quality video specifically created for Instagram, filmed on the beautiful premises of Curaçao by one of our team members. Only one other Instagram post of ours exceeded a reach of 900 (which was also a reel), with most revolving around 100. We learned from the success of our reel that it a good practice to invest time, effort and maybe also part of our budget for the creation of qualitative reels, as this type of video content seemed to be preferred by our audience.</li>
			<br>
		<li>Overall, our Instagram posts registered positive feedback regarding our visuals, from the use bright colours to the creative illustrations and beer labels. Consequently, we learned that our post-designing approach was appropriate for our audience.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Our TikTok videos had a high reach right from the start of our campaign, with an average of 500 per post. We learned that TikTok videos based on current trends and using popular sounds are the most effective on this platform. With 7/8 posts focused on trends, we also posted one TikTok video which was, in fact, the same as our popular Instagram Reel. Despite the success gathered on Instagram, the “Plot in paradise” video had the lowest reach among all our 8 posts on TikTok. From this experience, we confirmed that our strategy of following trends is the most effective one for our brand.</li>
				
</ul>
		
      
      
     
      
      <p class="medium_headers">&nbsp;What did not work?&nbsp;</p>
		
		<ul class="body_crp">
<li>Despite gaining a satisfying number of followers at the beginning of our campaign through WOM marketing, the number soon stalled at around 120. What we learned from this is that it is important to constantly and actively target new audiences, instead of sticking with the early audience base.</li>
			<br>
<li>We analysed the success of each type of post from our product triads, and we identified that the Personality Posts (on the right side) had the lowest reach. Compared with the other 2 posts, the Personality Posts were not as rich in content: they were not highly visual, had no illustrations and did not have a slideshow (as the left posts did). We conclude that we should not overlook the importance of providing posts high in visual content, as this factor proved to play an important role for our audience.</li>
			<br>
<li>We did not reach our TikTok goal, and we believe that the main reason is the number of videos we posted. Our TikTok videos had an average reach of approximately 500, which we considered to be a good reach for a newly-established brand. However, we noticed that the reach went down as time passed. Reading TikTok’s advice for business pages, we learned that it is recommended to post a video per day in order for the algorithm to show our videos to a high number of users. We posted 2 videos per week, amounting to 8 videos in total for the duration of our 4-week campaign. We learned from our experience on TikTok that we should aim to post at least 4 videos per week in order to keep our brand relevant. Had we done that, we would have probably achieved our goal.</li>
			<br>
<li>When creating our TikTok account, we had not informed ourselves about the steps that need to be followed in order to have access to all the Analytics functions. We understood that it is of utmost importance to have a clear plan of how each social media account should be created, in order to accurately track the progress of our brand.</li>
</ul>
      
     
      
     
<h4 class="mt-4 big_headers">Future Planning</h4>
	  <p class="body_crp">Reflecting on our experience with Plot’s marketing campaign, we are proud to have gained relevant insights into how we could optimize our brand’s future campaigns. 
		  Future recommendations: If the campaign would continue, we would apply the following practices&nbsp;</p>
		
		<ul class="body_crp">
<li>Create more highly-qualitative Instagram reels that fit the vision and style of our brand.</li>
			<br>
<li>Create content specifically made for the chosen platform where the video will be posted</li>
			<br>
<li>Before creating our social media accounts, have a clear planning on how to enable the desired functions (for example, the Analytics function on TikTok).</li>
			<br>
<li>Promote our brand to a larger audience through influencer marketing, collaborations with other brands and through boosting posts.</li>
			<br>
<li>Continue staying up to date with the newest TikTok trends and incorporate the brand’s values and products into TikTok videos</li>
			<br>
<li>Post a minimum of 4 videos per week on TikTok.</li>
</ul>
